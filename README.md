# -TBOI-Plus-CE
A very very downgraded version of the roguelike The Binding Of Isaac for the TI-84 Plus CE Graphing Calculator. Created using the TI-84 Plus CE C Toolchain (https://ce-programming.github.io/), written in C. 
The only files needed to be downloaded are TBOIPCE.8xp and clibs.8xg. To run the program, either use TI Connect CE to transfer the files to your real TI-84 Plus CE, using its charging cord, OR transfer the files to a TI-84 Plus CE emulator.
To run, press [PRGM], and select TBOIPCE. If this does not work, you may need to install the Artifice jailbreak, which can be found here -> (https://yvantt.github.io/arTIfiCE/)

CREDITS

This would not have been possible if it weren't for the creators of the TI-84 Plus CE C Toolchain's (https://ce-programming.github.io/) resources on converting C code to ez80 assembly. Sprites, and C programming done by SamothyQ.

This is my first time writing C code, as well as my first time using GitHub, so if there are any issues with the repository or egregious issues with the way I coded it, constructive criticism is welcomed.
